The `not` command is used to exclude some values from the records. 

Example:

``` SQL
select * from employees where job_id = 5 and not salary < 9000;
```

The above query will fetch `employes` whose `job_id` is 5, but the salary is not less than 9000.

Result:

You can see in the above example that we have only 2 `employees` with `job_id` 5 and a salary of more than 9000.

Using not and < is no use.

``` SQL
select * from employees where not salary > 9000 ;
```

instead of writing it as above, you could write it as,

``` SQL
select * from employees where salary < 9000 ;
```


# Ecto query for `not`

####  [not/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#not/1)

##### Expression

In Ecto, [not/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#not/1) is used to exclude values inside [where/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#where/3).

Example:

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> where([c], c.job_id == 5 and not(c.salary<9000)) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```


`where([c], c.job_id == 5 and not(c.salary<9000))`-> Here `[c]` is the reference variable that is used to refer to `HR.Employee`. To know about reference variable, refer to [[02. Aliases in Ecto]]. We are writing a condition saying `job_id` should be 5, and the salary is not less than 9000.

Result:

``` Elixir
IEx(16)> HR.Employee |> where([c], c.job_id == 5 and not(c.salary<9000) ) |> HR.Repo.all()

[
  %HR.Employee{
    __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, "employees">,
    employee_id: 101,
    first_name: "Neena",
    last_name: "Kochhar",
    email: "neena.kochhar@sqltutorial.org",
    phone_number: "515.123.4568",
    hire_date: ~D[1989-09-21],
    salary: Decimal.new("17000.00"),
    manager_id: 100,
    job_id: 5,
    department_id: 9
  },
  %HR.Employee{
    __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, "employees">,
    employee_id: 102,
    first_name: "Lex",
    last_name: "De Haan",
    email: "lex.de haan@sqltutorial.org",
    phone_number: "515.123.4569",
    hire_date: ~D[1993-01-13],
    salary: Decimal.new("17000.00"),
    manager_id: 100,
    job_id: 5,
    department_id: 9
  }
]
