In Ecto, aliases are used to set names for modules. You can reference the module by that name and access everything inside it. Essentially, it is a variable used to refer to a module. Whenever you want to access that module, you can use that variable to access it. You can use these aliases in both modules and Ecto queries.

##### In modules,

 This module, `SqlEcto.Hr`, is created for project functionalities. It includes two aliases: `HR.Country` and `HR.Repo`.

`alias HR.Country` -> Meaning, In the `SqlEcto.HR` module, whenever we want to do some functionalities with `HR.Country`, we can use `Country` instead of `HR.Country`. This `alias` will create an alias for the module with its last word. For `HR.Repo` the alias is `Repo`.  This practice helps developers use their time more efficiently, as they can use only the last word instead of typing the entire module name.

##### In Ecto queries,


```Elixir
HR.Country 
|> select([c], c) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

The above query is designed to retrieve all records from `HR.Country`.
Here, `[c]` serves as the reference variable for `HR.Country`.  `[c]` represents `HR.Country`. Whenever you want to refer to `HR.Country` in the whole query, you can use `c`. You can use whatever name you want when you refer to any module.  

For instance, you can also

```Elixir
HR.Country 
|> select([country], country) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

We are putting the variable inside a list.  Otherwise, it will result in an error.

The error indicates that the binding (the referenced variable) should be a list." So The output of this query will be a list because we put our alias inside a list. 

retrieve specific fields, you can do so by.

```Elixir
HR.Country 
|> select([c], [c.first_name, c.email]) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

You can access the fields in the module as shown in the above example.
