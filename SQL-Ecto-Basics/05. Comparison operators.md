In `SQL` and `Ecto`, comparison operators are used to compare values, allowing you to filter results based on specified conditions.
##### Comparison operators

In `SQL` and `Ecto`, comparison operators are the same. only equal to will vary. In SQL = is used , in `Ecto` == is used

In `SQL` 

`=`           Equal to
`!=`          Not equal to
\<           Less than
\>           Greater than
\>=         Greater than or equal to
`<=`         Less than or equal to 

In `Ecto`

`==`           Equal to
`!=`          Not equal to
\<           Less than
\>           Greater than
\>=         Greater than or equal to
`<=`         Less than or equal to 


##### SQL

Example 1: 

Let's select those records from [`employees`](01.%20Introduction) whose salary is **less than** 6000 using the less than(<) operator.

``` SQL
select * from employees where salary < 6000;
```

Result:

Example 2:

``` SQL
select * from locations where country_id = 'US';
```

As we saw in the `where` query, We are selecting locations whose `country_id` is **equal to** 'US', using the equal to (=) operator.

##### Ecto

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> where([c], c.salary < 6000) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

We are fetching `HR.Employee` whose salary is **less than** 6000 using less than (<) operator.

```Elixir
HR.Location 
|> where([c], c.country_id == "US") 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

will fetch `HR.Location` whose `country_id` is equal to `US` using == operators.
