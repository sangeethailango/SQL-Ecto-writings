The `between` command is used in the `where` to check for a range. It verifies whether the records have values within the specified range and is typically combined with the `and` command.

For Example:

``` SQL
select * from employees where job_id between 5 and 9;
```

The above code will check for [`employees`](01.%20Introduction) whose `job_id` falls within the range of 5 to 9. It  matches exact values.

Alternatively, the same result can be achieved using the following SQL code:

``` SQL
select * from employees where job_id >= 5 and job_id <= 9;
```

Both sets of code will give the same results.

Result:

As seen in the displayed records, the `job_id` values are between 5 and 9.

# Ecto query for `between`

Ecto does not have a specific `between` function. However, you can filter your records within a particular range using the `fragement/1`, as described in the https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#fragment/1, or by utilizing comparison operators.
