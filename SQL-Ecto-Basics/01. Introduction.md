In this tutorial, you will learn about SQL queries and their equivalent Ecto queries. Both are used to interact with the database. 

### SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language to interact with the database. Now let's explore the database used in this tutorial.

#### **Database**

I took this database from [sql-sample-database](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/) 

I've named my database as `sql_ecto_repo`. It has 7 tables. 

This database manages the HR data of a small business.

1. The `employees` table stores the data of employees.
2. The `jobs` table stores the job data including job title and salary range.
3. The `departments` table stores department data.
4. The `dependents` table stores the employee’s dependents.
5. The `locations` table stores the location of the departments of the company.
6. The `countries` table stores the data of countries where the company is doing business.
7. The `regions` table stores the data of regions such as Asia, Europe, America, and the Middle East and Africa. The countries are grouped into regions.

The diagram below illustrates the tables in the `sql_ecto_repo` database.

Number of records in each table:

- employees      -     31
- dependents    -     30
- departments   -     11
- jobs                 -     11
- locations         -      7
- countries         -      25
- regions            -      4 


### [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html)

Ecto is an elixir library which is a wrapper around the database in elixir. Ecto allows us to interact with the database. Ecto has 4 main components. 

 1. [Ecto.Schema](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html)
 2. [Ecto.Repo](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html)
 3. [Ecto.Query](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html)
 4. [Ecto.Changeset](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html)

`Ecto.Schema` is used to tell the database about the structure of our table such as what columns/fields should be there, their datatypes, relations, and everything.  `Ecto.Repo` is used to create, delete, update, to do queries in the databases. `Ecto.Query` is used to do queries from the `Ecto.Repo`.  `Ecto.Changeset` is used to set constraints for the columns, or you can set how you want the value to be inserted, You can cast the columns. 

###  [Schema](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html)

Our `Ecto.Repo` is named as `Hr.Repo`. Feel free to explore the GitHub repository below to see the schema structure that is being used in this tutorial.

Every SQL query has it's own Ecto query and vice versa. Let's see some of the SQL queries and their equivalent Ecto queries in this tutorial.
