The `where` command is used to select records based on a condition. It returns only those records that satisfy the conditions specified in the `where` command, effectively filtering the records."

For Example:

In the [employees](01.%20Introduction) table, Let's select only those records whose `salary` is 9000.

``` SQL
select * from employees where salary = 9000;
```

Following `where`,  `salary` is the  column name which has to be equal to the value 9000. `select` `from` `where` has to be in this order only.

Result:

###### **Note:**

 In SQL, anything inside single quotes (' ') is treated as a string. For example, '123' is a string, and 'name' is also a string. Anything inside double quotes (' ') is treated as a column name. If you put any words inside double quotes, SQL will consider them as a column name and search for it."

As you see In the above example, it says ***column "9000" does not exist***. SQL considers "9000" as a column name. 


# Ecto query for `where` 

#### [where/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#where/3) 

##### Expression

In [Ecto.Query]([Ecto.Query](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html)., `where/3` is used to fetch records based on the particular value.

For Example:

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> where([c], c.salary == 9000) 
|> HR.Repo.all() 
```

Result:

 ```Elixir
 IEx(26)> HR.Employee |> where([c], c.salary == 9000) |> HR.Repo.all() 

[
  %HR.Employee{
    __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, "employees">,
    employee_id: 103,
    first_name: "Alexander",
    last_name: "Hunold",
    email: "alexander.hunold@sqltutorial.org",
    phone_number: "590.423.4567",
    hire_date: ~D[1990-01-03],
    salary: Decimal.new("9000.00"),
    manager_id: 102,
    job_id: 9,
    department_id: 6
  },
  %HR.Employee{
    __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, "employees">,
    employee_id: 109,
    first_name: "Daniel",
    last_name: "Faviet",
    email: "daniel.faviet@sqltutorial.org",
    phone_number: "515.124.4169",
    hire_date: ~D[1994-08-16],
    salary: Decimal.new("9000.00"),
    manager_id: 108,
    job_id: 6,
    department_id: 10
  }
]
```

`where([c], c.salary == 9000)` -> Here `[c]` is the reference variable which is used to refer to `HR.Employee`. This query will fetch the `HR.Employee` struct which `salary` is equal to 9000.  Refer [[02. Aliases in Ecto]] to know about aliases/reference variables.

##### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, where: c.salary == 9000) 
```

`where` is a key. `c.salary == 9000` is its value which says only `salary` is equal to 9000 should get returned.
