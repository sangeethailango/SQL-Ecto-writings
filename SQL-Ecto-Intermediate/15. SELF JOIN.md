The `SELF JOIN` command, used to join the same table with it's own table based on the queries. 

For Example:

Let's use `locations` table for this query. Refer [[01. Introduction]] to know about this table and the database.

This is the `locations` table. You can see that lot of records have same `country_id` such as `US`, `UK`. So Let's do query to find what are all the `street_address` are from what `country_id`.

``` SQL
SELECT A.street_address AS street_address_1, B.street_address AS street_address_2, A.country_id FROM locations A, locations B WHERE A.street_address <> B.street_address AND A.country_id = B.country_id;
```

Here, i am fetching `street_address_1`, `street_address_2` from `locations_1`, `locations_2`. In `where` condition, i am saying `street_address` should not match each other and `country_id` should be same. So it will look for `street_address` whose `country_id` are same and will return.

Result:
