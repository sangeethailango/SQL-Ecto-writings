The `HAVING` command is used to perform aggregate functions such as `AVG`,`COUNT`, and `MAX`  in a `group_by`.  You cannot do aggregate functions in the `WHERE` clause. 

For Example:

``` SQL
select salary, count(salary) from employees group by salary having count(salary) = 2;
```

Here, we are only returning `salary` and the count of the grouped `salary` if the count is equal to 2. We are specifying which grouped items should be returned in the table [`employees`](https://chat.openai.com/c/01.%20Introduction). The count should be equal to 2.

Result:

 In the above example, all the counts of the records are 2. We have a total of 2 `employees` who receive 8200 as salary, 2 `employees` who receive 4800 as salary, 2 `employees` who receive 17000 as salary. 

# Ecto query for `HAVING`

#### [having/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#having/3) 

The `having/3` function allows you to perform aggregate functions in join and to filter the rows that are grouped.

##### Expressions

For example:

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> group_by([c], c.salary)
|> having([c], count(c.salary)==2) 
|> select([c], %{"salary" => c.salary, "count" => count(c.salary)})
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

`having([c], count(c.salary)==2)`  -> `[c]` is the  [reference variable](02.%20Aliases%20in%20Ecto). Refer [[02. Aliases in Ecto]] to understand aliases/reference variables 
`count(c.salary)==2)` ->  Here,  the `count` function is used to specify that the count of the `salary` should be 2. We are specifying to return the grouped rows where the count of the `salary` is equal to 2.

Result:

##### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, group_by: c.salary, having: count(c.salary)==2, select: %{"salary" => c.salary, "count" => count(c.job_id)}) 
```

`select:` is a key. `e` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.
