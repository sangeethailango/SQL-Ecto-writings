To get the maximum and minimum value of a column `MAX` and `MIN` is used. The value can be a numerical, character string or date. 
For numerical the highest number will come as the max and lowest number will come as the min. For string character the closest value that starting from A will come as the minimum and the closest value that starting from Z will come as max.

Example:

Let's find out highest and lowest of `max_salary` column.

``` SQL
SELECT MAX(max_salary) FROM jobs;
```

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231106152738.png]]

So the highest `max_salary` is 40000.

``` SQL
SELECT MIN(max_salary) FROM jobs;
```

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231106152858.png]]

So the lowest `max_salary` is 5000.

##### Example to find highest and lowest values in string characters

``` SQL
SELECT MAX(job_title) FROM jobs;
```

Result:

As you can see that, `max` gives the value which starting letter is closest to Z.

``` SQL
SELECT MIN(job_title) FROM jobs;
```

Result:

As you can see that, `min` is giving the value which starting letter is closest to A

# Ecto for `MAX` & `MIN`

#### [max/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#max/1)

`max/1`  is used to find the maximum value of a particular field in a schema.

Example:

``` Elixir
SqlEcto.Hr.Job |> select([c], max(c.max_salary)) |> SqlEcto.Repo.all() 
```

Result:

#### [min/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#min/1)

`min/1` is used to find the lowest value of a particular field in a schema

```Elixir
SqlEcto.Hr.Job |> select([c], min(c.max_salary)) |> SqlEcto.Repo.all()
```

Result:
