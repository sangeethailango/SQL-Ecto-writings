The `MAX` and `MIN` are used to get the maximum and minimum values of a column which value can be numerical, character string, or dates. For numerical values, the highest number is returned as the maximum, and the lowest number is returned as the minimum. When dealing with string characters, the closest value starting from 'A' is returned as the minimum, and the closest value starting from 'Z' is returned as the maximum.

For Example:

Let's find out the highest and lowest of the `salary` column from the table [`employees`](01.%20Introduction).

### `max`

``` SQL
select max(salary) from employees;
```

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116150038.png]]

The highest `salary` is 24000.

To find the highest value in string characters:

``` SQL
select max(first_name) from employees;
```

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116150410.png]]

As observed, `MAX` returns the value with the starting letter closest to Z, which is V.

### `min`

``` SQL
select min(salary) from employees;
```

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116150152.png]]

So the lowest `salary` is 2500.

To find the lowest value in string characters:

``` SQL
select min(first_name) from employees;
```

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116150503.png]]

As observed, `MIN` returns the value with the starting letter closest to A.

# Ecto for `MAX` & `MIN`

#### [max/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#max/1)

The `max/1` function is used to find the maximum value of a specific field in a schema.

##### Expressions

For Example:

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> select([c], max(c.salary)) 
|> HR.Repo.all() 
```

Here, `c` is the reference variable referring to `HR.Employee`. Refer [[02. Aliases in Ecto]] to understand aliases/reference variables. 

Result:

```Elixir
iex(60)> HR.Employee |> select([c], max(c.salary)) |> HR.Repo.all() 
[Decimal.new("24000.00")]
```

The maximum value in the `salary` field is 24000.

##### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, select: max(c.salary))   
```

#### [min/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#min/1)

The `min/1` function is used to find the lowest value of a specific field in a schema

##### Expressions

For Example:

```Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> select([c], min(c.salary)) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

Result:

```Elixir
iex(62)> HR.Employee |> select([c], min(c.salary)) |> HR.Repo.all()
[Decimal.new("2500.00")]
```

The minimum value in the `salary` field is 2500.

##### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, select: min(c.salary))   
```

`select:` is a key. `c` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.
