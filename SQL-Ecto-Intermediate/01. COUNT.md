The `COUNT` command is used to count the total number of non-null values for a particular  column. You can also count the entire table.

For Example:

![[Pasted image 20231116133453.png]]

The above is the [`employees`](01.%20Introduction)  table. The following syntax is used to get the total number of rows in this table.

``` SQL
select count(*) from employees;
```

\*  refers to the entire table.

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116133523.png]]

Now, let's count the non-null `phone_number` rows.

``` SQL
select count(phone_number) from employees;
```

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116133548.png]]

You can see that when we counted the entire table using `*` the result was 31, but when I counted only `phone_number` rows, the result was 25.  It's because some records have a null value in the `phone_number` column. 

# Ecto query for `COUNT`

#### [count/0](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#count/0)

The `count/0` function is used to get the total number of inserted records in a schema. 

##### Expressions

For Example:

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> select([c], count()) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

Here, `c` is the reference variable that refers to `HR.Employee`. Refer [[02. Aliases in Ecto]] to know about aliases/reference variables.

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116133750.png]]

The total number of records for `HR.Employees` is 31 as you can see in the above example.

##### Keywords

``` Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, select: count())  
```

`select:` is a key. `c` is a value that is a reference variable for the `HR.Employee` schema. We are counting all the records from `HR.Employee`.x 
#### [count/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#count/1)

The `count/1` function is used to calculate the total number of non-null values for a particular field in a schema

##### Expressions

Example:

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> select([c], count(c.phone_number)) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

`count(c.phone_number)` ->  We are calculating the count of `phone_number` for `HR.Employee`.`c` is the reference variable referring to the `HR.Employee`. 

Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116134048.png]]

The total number of records that `phone_number` has a non-null value is 19.

##### Keywords

``` Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, select: count(c.phone_number))
```

`select:` is a key. `c` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.
