The `union` command is used to do multiple queries at once. By using `union`,  Both queries will return a single table.

##### `union`

For Example:

Let's use the `countries` table and `regions` table for this example. Refer [[01. Introduction]] to know about this table and the database.

``` SQL
select region_id from regions union select region_id from countries;
```

Here, we are executing two queries and combining them using `union`. This query will return `region_id` from both the tables without duplicate values.

In `union`,

- The column names must be the same in both queries. Using different column names will result in an error.
- Both columns should have the same data types.

Result:

Here, you can see that `region_id` from both table has been returned  without duplicates.

To include duplicates, use `union all`.

##### `union all`

`union all` will return duplicate values as well.

For Example:

``` SQL
select region_id from regions union all select region_id from countries;
```

Result:

# Ecto query for `union`

### [union/2](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#union/2) 

In Ecto `union/2` allows you to combine multiple queries. `union/2` expects two arguments. So let's create two queries and combine them using the `union/2` function. 

##### Expression

For example:


``` Elixir
region_id_from_country = 
HR.Country 
|> select([c], %{"region_id" => c.region_id}) 
```

Here, we are selecting `region_id` from `HR.Country` and assigning it to a variable called `region_id_from_country`. Here `c` is the reference variable; refer [[02. Aliases in Ecto]] to know about reference variables.


``` Elixir
region_id_from_region = 
HR.Region 
|> select([r], %{"region_id" => r.region_id})
```

Here, we are selecting `region_id` from `HR.Region` and assigning it to a variable called `region_id_from_region`.  We are putting both queries in a map data structure using `%{}`. Let's combine both queries.


``` Elixir
union(region_id_from_country, ^region_id_from_region) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

Here, we are combining both queries. Union expects its second argument to contain the  `^` symbol to indicate that the argument is already defined.  

Result:

##### Keywords

```Elixir
region_id_from_country = from c in HR.Country, select: %{"region_id" => c.region_id}
```

```Elixir
region_id_from_region = from c in HR.Region, select: %{"region_id" => c.region_id}, union: ^region_id_from_country
```

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(region_id_from_region)
```

##### `union_all`

As we mentioned, the result is returned in a map `%{}`. To include duplicate values, use [union_all/2](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#union_all/2) function.

``` Elixir
 union_all(region_id_from_country, ^region_id_from_region) |> HR.Repo.all()  
```

Result:

##### Keywords

Change `union` to `union_all` for the keywords syntax.
