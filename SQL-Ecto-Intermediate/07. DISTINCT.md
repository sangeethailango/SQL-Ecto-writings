The `distinct` command is used to get unique values from any columns in a table. Using the `distinct` keyword, you can see all the distinct values present in a particular table. 

For Example:

Let's use the `locations` table for this query. To learn more about this table and the database, refer to [[01. Introduction]].

 you can find what are all the `country_id` values present in the `locations` table. When you use the `distinct` keyword for any column, the duplicates in that column won't be returned.  Although the `locations` table has 3 `country_id` entries as `US`, using `distinct` will only return one. Even if there are 10 `street_address` entries with the same `country_id`, `distinct` will only return one.

``` SQL
select distinct country_id from locations;
```

The above query will return all the unique `country_id` values in the `locations` table.

Result:

We have 4 unique `country_id` values in the `locations` table.

# Ecto query for `DISTINCT`

#### [distinct/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#distinct/3)

In Ecto, you can obtain all unique values in a field using the `distinct/3` function. To see all the unique `country_id` values present in `HR.Location`, you can use the following:

##### Expressions

For Example:

``` Elixir
HR.Location 
|> select([l], [l.country_id]) 
|> distinct(true) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

The above query will return all the unique values from the `country_id` field in `HR.Location`. Here `l` is the reference variable that refers to `HR.Location`. To know about reference variable visit [[02. Aliases in Ecto]] 


Result:

![[Pasted image 20231116223313.png]]

So we have a total of 4 unique `country_id` values present in `HR.Location`.

##### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from l in HR.Location, distinct: true, select: l.country_id)
```

`select:` is a key. `c` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.
