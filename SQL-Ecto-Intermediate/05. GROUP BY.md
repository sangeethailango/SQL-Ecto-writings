The `GROUP BY` command is used to group rows with the same value in a particular column and perform aggregate functions on those grouped rows.

For Example:

if you want to know how many records have the same value in the `salary` column from the table [`employees`](01.%20Introduction), you can group those records using the following query:

``` SQL
select salary, count(salary) from employees group by salary;
```

Result:

Explanation:

- Select `salary` to appear in the table.
- Count the occurrences of each `salary`.
- Group the records by `salary`, meaning all records with the same value in the `salary` column will be grouped.
- `count(salary)` will count the grouped column. If, for example, three columns were grouped, `count(salary)` will return 3.

It's important to print the columns that you are trying to group by. If you attempt to print a column that doesn't come after the `GROUP BY` keyword, you will get an error. For example:

In the above example, an error occurs because I am grouping by `salary` by counting the `job_id` column. This means it will group by `salary` and count how many `job_id` are grouped. However, an error is triggered because I am trying to print the `job_id`, which is a count. You can apply the aggregate function to any column, but for printing, the column that you put after `group by` and the column being printed has to be the same.  You can use `count` for any column. it will simply count the occurrences of that column so that you can have a count of how many columns are grouped.

In the above example, after changing the query to:

``` SQL
select salary, count(job_id) from employees group by salary;
```

After changing `job_id` to `salary` from being selected, it works.

# Ecto query for `GROUP BY`

#### [group_by/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#group_by/3)

In Ecto, the `group_by/3` function is used to group fields with the same value. `group_by/3` accepts three arguments:

1. A schema
2. Reference variable for the schema. Refer [[02. Aliases in Ecto]] to understand aliases/reference variables 
3. A field used to grouping

##### Expressions

For example:

``` Elixir
HR.Employee 
|> group_by([e], e.salary) 
|> select([e], %{"salary" => e.salary, "count" => count(e.job_id)}) 
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

The above query returns results from grouping `HR.Employees` records with the same `salary`

Explanation:

`group_by([e], e.salary)` -> `[e]` is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`, and `e.salary` is the field that is grouped by.

`select([e], %{"salary" => e.salary, "count" => count(e.job_id)})` -> `[e]` is the reference variable. `%{}` is used because the results are wanted in a map. - The map returns the grouped `salary` and the count of how many `job_id` share that `salary`.

Result:

So, `salary` is grouped, and the count of how many `job_id` of employees share that `salary` is determined.

##### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from e in HR.Employee, group_by: e.salary, select: %{"salary" => e.salary, "count" => count(e.job_id)}) 
```

`select:` is a key. `e` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.
